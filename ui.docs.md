# üèÜ Wrestling Club App ‚Äì Project Overview

This project is a **multi-tenant sports-management platform** built for wrestling clubs.  
It‚Äôs designed to serve three primary user types‚Äî**Admins, Coaches, and Wrestlers/Parents**‚Äîacross both **mobile (Expo)** and **web (Next.js)** apps.  

The goal is to simplify club operations by providing:
- Centralized practice and tournament scheduling  
- Seamless session enrollment and payments  
- Transparent attendance and roster tracking  
- Relationship management between parents and wrestlers  
- Scalable, white-label architecture so new clubs can launch quickly  

## üß± Architecture
- **Frontend:** Expo (React Native) for mobile and Next.js for web  
- **Backend:** Convex for real-time data sync and role-based permissions  
- **Payments:** Stripe (per-practice and per-session)  
- **Design System:** shadcn-style component library with theming via CSS variables  
- **Theming:** `--color-primary` (#0f52ba) and `--color-secondary` (#ffffff) are global variables; change per club for white-label branding.

## üë• Roles & Permissions
| Role | Capabilities |
|------|---------------|
| **Admin** | Full CRUD on sessions, practices, tournaments, pricing, and member roles. |
| **Coach** | Manage events, track attendance, view payments, and can also act as parent/wrestler. |
| **Parent/Wrestler** | Enroll and pay for sessions, check in to practices, view schedules, show interest in tournaments, and link to one another. |

## üß≠ Core Features
1. **Authentication & Role Management**  
   Sign up as coach/parent/wrestler. Admins approve coaches; admins are DB-assigned. Coaches can switch between roles.  

2. **Sessions & Practices**  
   Groups of practices with weekly repeats. Wrestlers/parents can enroll and pay per session or per practice. Coaches/admins view attendance and payment status.

3. **Tournaments**  
   Wrestlers/parents show interest (with weight class). Coaches/admins manage rosters, teams, and attendance.

4. **Payments**  
   Admins set pricing; parents/wrestlers pay via Stripe. Coaches/admins monitor paid/unpaid status.

5. **Relationships**  
   Parents/wrestlers can link or invite each other to manage connected profiles.

6. **Attendance & Check-In**  
   Live check-in for practices with rosters visible to coaches/admins.

## üíª Platform Parity
Both mobile and web apps share the same core functionality, ensuring users can perform all tasks from either device.
